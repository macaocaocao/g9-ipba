                    <div class="dez">We've chosen podcasts as our content category. Podcasts are not only a popular content type but also the best choice for us because they provide a more laid-back approach to learning about different topics, which can be more appealing to students than traditional school materials. With over 2 billion active users per month, podcasts offer an extensive audience base, allowing us to reach a wider group of students. We have selected a specific topic for our podcast, “A Look into a Student’s Life.” This topic allows us to dive into the experiences, challenges, and personal growth stories of students, making it relatable to our target audience. While discussing these student-focused topics, our podcast will also promote fundraising efforts for Sitio Bebe, raising awareness and support for their needs.

                    <div class="name">Target Audience</div>
                    <div class="dez">Our chosen target audience consists of junior to senior high students, and podcasts are particularly popular with this group. Students are attracted to podcasts because of their relatable content, engaging storytelling, and easy accessibility. They can listen to podcasts anytime and anywhere, making learning more flexible and convenient. High school students have diverse interests and hobbies, so they are likely to enjoy podcasts that cover a wide range of topics, including music, games, and everyday teen experiences. Audio content often resonates better than written material for high school students because it allows them to multitask or unwind while learning something new. This makes podcasts an attractive option for busy students who can listen while commuting, exercising, or doing chores, seamlessly incorporating learning into their daily routines.</div>

By featuring guest speakers who share their experiences, we want to spark inspiration in our listeners. As we discuss their lives, we will offer valuable insights that can help students relate to, influence, and learn from each other. <br><br>
                        Our podcast addresses common challenges high school students face, such as stress, time management, and self-discovery. We will also provide practical tips and advice that listeners can apply to their own lives, making the content relatable and actionable. This includes study techniques, mental health resources, and strategies for personal growth.
